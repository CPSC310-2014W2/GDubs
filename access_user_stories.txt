User story for user login/logout

As a user I want to be able to enter the system through my Google account, so that I am directed to the main page.

Notes:
GWT has a nice api for adding login/logout functionality, as seen in assignment 1.

Definitions of done:
	- A user who has an invalid Google account - response of the system should keep the user at the login page prompting the user to reattempt to log in.
	- A user who has a valid Google account but invalid password - response of the system should keep the user at the login page prompting the user to reattempt to log in.
	- A user who has a valid Google account and valid credentials - response of the system should be to bring the user to the main page.

Tasks:
	- Add functionality to the system so that the site is only accessible after successful login.
	- Add a button for the user to login.
	- Add a button for the user to logout once accepted by the system.

Effort Estimation:
	6 hours 



User story for user profile information and preferences

As a developer I want users to fill out a form containing personal information and account preferences, so that I can have better knowledge of the user domain and the ability to notify the user as per their preference.

Definitions of done:
	- A user that logs into the system for the first time - response of the system should be to prompt the user with a form to create a profile in order to obtain the user's name, age, location, and email address, as well as a form for specifying the users notification preferences.
	- A user that logs into the system after having created a profile - response of the system should be to bring the user to the main page.

Tasks:
	- Add functionality to the system so that the system prompts a new user with a form for creating a profile and specifying preferences.
	- Add functionality to the system so that the system does not prompt a returning user with a form for creating a profile.
